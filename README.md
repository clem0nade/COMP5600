The majority of our project code is within the main file. Under the main file we have the dashboard file.
The dashboard file has an assets file, and 3 python files. The three python files are communicating with dash, setting and generating
maps and graphs. The python files also communicate with the database and set the variables for our demographics that the data is
separated by.
Within the assets folder, there are JavaScript and css files which are for the layouts and appearance of the information on our site.

Next, the static file has a single css file which adds some animations and adds some style to the project site and a js file 
that holds two files with more JavaScript for the site to make sure everything is presentable and readable

The templates file holds some base html files and underneath that are 2 python files that set up more connections and ensure everything
works according to plan

The last important file is requirements.txt as that lists all of the necessary imports and tools for our system to run
